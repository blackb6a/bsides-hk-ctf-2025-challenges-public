JSON Weak Token Revenge
===

## Summary

* **Author:** ensy
* **Categories:** web, crypto
* **Difficulty:** ★★☆☆☆ (2)
* **Points:** 250
* **Solves:** 4 (Player: 4/16)

## Description (en)

I made this other web server to also demonstrate how JWT works, and I again hid a flag inside only available for admins!

Don't even bother to get the flag, there's no way you can obtain admin!

Note that although the challenge name says "revenge", this challenge does not actually have anything to do with the challenge "JSON Weak Token" itself.
